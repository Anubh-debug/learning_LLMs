So far, India has 16,689 active cases. There are also 77 foreign nationals who are affected by the virus, the ministry said. Apart from that, there are at least 4,324 patients who have been discharged or cured from the highly contagious disease and one has migrated from the country. Speaking at the press briefing today, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry, said, \"As on today, we have 12 districts that did not have a fresh case in the last 28 days or more. There are now 78 districts (23 States/UTs) that has not reported any fresh cases during the last 14 Days.\" However, he also said that the increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the country is \"more or less linear, not exponential.\" According to the Thursday morning data of health ministry, 4,257 Covid-19 patients have been cured so far, bring the recovery rate to is 19.89% as of now, said Aggrawal. He also added, \"We have been able to cut virus transmission, minimise spread of COVID-19 in 30 days of lockdown.\"\n",
